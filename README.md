# Unity3D_RacingGame
## Zipped Unity project with build: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LE-ardlcIX7pctxRDh4Xfjk5PhDBBorE/view?usp=sharing

Project created using Unity game engine. I also used Blender to make 3D objects and GIMP to prepare textures for some objects. It's a racing game where you have to set fastest lap in session within 3 laps. Car takes corners sideways (drifting). Steering is like:
  LMB - drive forward
  RMB - brake/drive backward
  Mouse Cursor - point where you want the car to turn
  Esc - pause game
